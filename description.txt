Currently supports patch 1.12.

If you're playing on any version below 1.9, please use the legacy version of this mod instead: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020606549

This mod gives players full and direct control of peace conference proceedings in wars they are involved in.

IMPORTANT: You may need to press "Pass" a couple of times before the AI gives you their points.

You can distribute territory to your allies by clicking on their flag and then clicking on the map.
Wars without player involvement conclude as normal.

This mod makes no changes to anything else other than peace conference AI and is compatible with any and all other mods and will work in multiplayer games.
